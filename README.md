# Apartment Price Prediction

### Introduction:
This project is inspired by the famous House Price prediction project on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) 

The targeted housing market for this project is Dubai, United Arab Emirates. We will be exploring the market data scrapped from one of the famous real estate search engines in Dubai. We will only be modeling around apartment type residential units.

Our data, which is scrapped using selenium and beautifulsoup, consists of necessary information containing primary details (bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage area, prices, and list of amenities)

This project includes feature engineering to make data relevant and usable for ML model building.
