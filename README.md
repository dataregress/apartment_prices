# Apartment Price Prediction

### Introduction:
This project is inspired by the famous House Price prediction project on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) 

The targeted housing market for this project is Dubai, United Arab Emirates. We will be exploring the market data scrapped from one of the famous real estate search engines in Dubai. We will only be modeling around apartment type residential units.

Our data, which is scrapped using selenium and beautifulsoup, consists of necessary information containing primary details (bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage area, prices, and list of amenities)

This project includes feature engineering to make data relevant and usable for ML model building.

### Credits:
I want to give credit to Ömer Sakarya from towardsdatascience.com. his code in scrapping glassdoor gave me the idea link below

The data has been anonymized and is not scrapped for commercial usage.

### Notes:

Do note that the scrapping is very specific to a portal that I chose for my data source. I have obscured the URL, just in case. The purpose is to showcase the logics and technics went into scrapping data.
